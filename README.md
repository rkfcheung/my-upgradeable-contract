[Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com/overview/ethereum) - [How to Deploy an Upgradeable Vending Machine Smart Contract](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/md/63bfe506016d9c00049221fc)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
